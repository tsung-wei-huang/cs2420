# Labs

Lab questions are covered in the class and the instructor will stay onlin
to help directly. 
Although you don't need to participate in any classes on Friday, 
you need to enroll in the Lab section (class #19145).

# Exams

## Midterm: 10/25 - 11/1 (take-home exam)

We will have our first midterm on the week of 10/25 - 11/1.
There are a couple of things to know:

  + Midterm will be take-home
  + Midterm will cover both concept and programming questions we have lectured so far
  + Midterm will count for *10-30%* of your final grade (PS: the actual ratio may be adjusted)

We believe learning how to find solutions using the internet and your social network is important in today's software engineering landscape.
As a result, you are completely free to:
  + use the internet resources
  + discuss the questions with your friends

However, this doesn't mean you can simply copy the solutions from others.
We trust you but don't take it for granted. 
Ultimately, it is your knowledge and career, not ours.
Never violate the [rules of academic integrity](https://regulations.utah.edu/academics/6-400.php). 

You will need to upload your solution through Canvas by the end of 11/1.


## Final Exam: TBD
